In a thesis, it is common to mention the assistance of
people whose help was crucial but not extensive enough to warrant
their being listed as co-authors. Thesis advisors, technicians, and
colleagues  who gave advice or time are all candidates for the
acknowledgments section. Patient family members are also frequently thanked.
