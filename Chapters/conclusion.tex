\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion} 

Some readers of documents, particularly managers, will sometimes not read the entire document but, instead, focus on the conclusion. Hence, this part of the report should summarize all essential information necessary for your audience's purpose. 

In some sense the conclusion is a summary of the discussion chapter. You must relate your findings to the research questions stated in the  introduction, in other words, present the short version of the answer to the research question.
You should also summarize clearly what the report does and does not demonstrate, and what you think is your main contribution to scientific community.

Finally, it is often appropriate to include specific recommendations for future research. Sometimes these recommendations will constitute a separate section.

The conclusion should be relatively short, a page or two is fine.
